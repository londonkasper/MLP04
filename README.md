# MLP04: Dimensionality Reduction and Feature Spaces
### Jeremy Waibel & London Kasper
This project dives into dimesionality reduction and explores a few methods of feature selection. We used a dataset provided by Trinity Industries and included a large section of EDA followed by a dimensionality reductions. We then compared the different methods of reduction and selection and analyzed our final model. <br></br>See the pdf found in the repository for the full Jupyter Notebook containing all code from the analysis.
